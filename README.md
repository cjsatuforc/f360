# Fusion 360

This repository stores some Fusion 360 scripts that I have written and would like to share

## SkConstraint

A very simple script to check if a sketch is constrained. More precisely, whether Fusion 360 thinks it is constrained, which isn't always the same thing

## ParamDump

A script to go through all the user and model parameters and dump them to a file. It is to answer the question: Where is a specific parameter being used? If I change this parameter, which bodies or sketches are affected?
